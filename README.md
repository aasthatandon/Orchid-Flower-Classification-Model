# Orchid-Flower-Classification-Model
Orchid Flower Species Classification :
Developed CNN Classification Model to classify Species from the Orchid Flowers dataset

### Data source:
Dataset is available at the following link : https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0HNECY

### What analysis were performed
```Orchid_Species_Classification_Model.ipynb``` : This notebook contains the following  :
-  Model 1  CNN Classification Model from scratch
-  Model 2: Used Transfer learning or fine-tuning to build the model

```Orchid_Multitask_Model.ipynb``` : Built a multi-task model that predicts the species and number of flowers using functional API and two output layers.
